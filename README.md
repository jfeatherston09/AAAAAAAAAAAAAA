# TowerDefenseTemplate
 Made by Jackson Featherston.
Added a titlescreen, a tileset, enemies that followed the path and could be killed after two hits of a bullet, bullets that could damage and kill enemies, towers that can fire bullets based on a collision radius, and made a GUI system that while incomplete, is present. I'd recommend dragging in a tower scene from the tower folder to see them in action because as of now you won't be able to see them otherwise due to the GUI being broken. All of this is being written at the project's conclusion, so I don't have any dates to add or anything. All art is custom made from the slimes to the towers to the titlescreen to the bullets to the tilemap to the...you get the point.
